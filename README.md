## Overview
This lab demonstrates the analysis of captured network traffic to extract useful information such as IP addresses, protocols, flags, and user activity. The objective is to understand how data is transmitted over the network and to identify key patterns and behaviors.

## Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the IP address?
- **Answer**: The IP address is `129.120.231.230`.

### Q2: Which browser was used?
- **Answer**: Mozilla Firefox.

### Q3: Which operating system was used?
- **Answer**: Linux.

### Q4: What is the purpose of the ACK flag?
- **Answer**:  
  The **ACK (Acknowledgment)** flag is used to acknowledge that data has been successfully received.  
  When a host receives a packet with the ACK flag set, it confirms that the previous packet was received successfully.

### Q5: Additional Packet Analysis
- **Answer**: Specific details for this question were not provided in the lab output.

### Q6: Packet Filtering
- **Answer**: Packet filtering was performed using the IP address `128.129.107.147`, which corresponds to **canvas.edu.unt**.

### Q7: What protocol is being used, and are credentials available?
- **Answer**:  
  - **Protocol**: TCP  
  - **Credentials**: No credentials were found during the analysis.
